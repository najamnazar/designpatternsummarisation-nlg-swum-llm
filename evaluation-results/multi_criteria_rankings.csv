The 16 methods of AbstractTransactionStatus are setRollbackOnly (void), isRollbackOnly (boolean), isLocalRollbackOnly (boolean), isGlobalRollbackOnly (boolean), setCompleted (void), isCompleted (boolean), hasSavepoint (boolean), setSavepoint (void), getSavepoint (Object), createAndHoldSavepoint (void), rollbackToHeldSavepoint (void), releaseHeldSavepoint (void), createSavepoint (Object), rollbackToSavepoint (void), releaseSavepoint (void) and getSavepointManager (SavepointManager). No methods call setRollbackOnly and setRollbackOnly calls no methods.
